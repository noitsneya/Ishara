# 🖐️ Ishara – Real-time Sign Language Interpreter 
Effective communication is a fundamental human right, yet Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) individuals often struggle with accessibility in real-time conversations, professional settings, and daily interactions. Existing sign language interpretation solutions are limited by high costs, availability of human interpreters, and inaccuracies in automated systems, especially for underrepresented sign languages like Indian Sign Language (ISL).
Ishara is an AI-powered real-time sign language interpreter  designed to bridge communication gaps for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. Using computer vision and deep learning, Ishara translates Indian Sign Language (ISL) into text and speech in real time.
